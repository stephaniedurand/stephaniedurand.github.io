I am a seismologist, focusing on global imaging of elastic, anisotropic and anelastic Earth’s mantle structures using surface waves, body waves and normal modes. Basically, the question I try to answer is what is the origin of the seismic heterogeneities in the Earth’s mantle and to do so we need to combine different information such as seismic velocities, anisotropy and attenuation.

You are curious, you want to know what is beneath your feet ? Have a look to our Python tool SeisTomoPy to investigate the interior of the Earth’s mantle.

We are currently looking for master and PhD students so if you are willing to join our seismology team in Lyon, write me an email :-)
